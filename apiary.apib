# 2.INTRODUCTION

Skrill Quick Checkout is a secure hosted payment page, where you can redirect customers from your website to make a payment through Skrill. Quick Checkout provides customers with access to a range of payment methods, based on their location and your account and integration settings.

Integration to Quick Checkout is simple and requires collecting customer payment information on your website and submitting this to Skrill. Quick Checkout then collects the customer payment details needed to complete the payment and sends these details to the relevant bank or alternative payment provider for authorisation.

After the payment is complete, the customer is returned to your website and you receive a real-time notification of the payment, which includes details of the transaction.

### Skrill payment flow

A simplified illustration of the Skrill payment flow is shown in the figure below.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_324395e1548821f7.jpg)

###### Figure 2‐1: Skrill transaction flow

1. When the customer is ready to pay for goods or services on your website, they select the Skrill payment option on your website.
2. You request a session identifier (SID) by passing customer and transaction details (for example: amount, currency and language) to Quick Checkout.
3. Skrill returns the generated SID.
4. Using a Lightbox, redirect the customer to Quick Checkout and include the session identifier in the redirect URL. Skrill displays the Quick Checkout page.
5. The customer enters their payment information, plus any other details requested, and confirms the transaction.
6. Skrill requests authorisation for the payment from the customer's bank, third party provider or card issuer.
7. The bank/provider approves or rejects the transaction.
8. Skrill displays the Quick Checkout confirmation page, containing the transaction result.
9. Skrill provides you with an asynchronous notification, sent to your status URL or IPN (instant Payment Notification), confirming the transaction details and status.

### Displaying Skrill as a payment option on your website

When a customer is on the checkout page of your website, there are a number of ways in which you can present the Skrill payment options to them:

- Display Pay by Skrill logos
- Display logos of specific payment methods

#### Display Pay by Skrill logos

The simplest integration option is to present a generic **Pay by Skrill** logo or button on your website, and then redirect the customer to the Skrill Quick Checkout page, where they can pay using a suitable method or log in to their Skrill account to pay from their account balance. This integration option ensures that your customers always have access to the full range of Skrill payment methods available in their country or region. See the example logos below.

![Shape6](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_af40ef0e36499f1c.gif)

You can download a copy of these logos in different sizes from the Skrill Website at:

[https://www.skrill.com/en/merchants/brand-centre](https://www.skrill.com/en/merchants/brand-centre)

#### Display logos of specific payment methods

An alternative option is to present only the logos of the specific payment methods you want to offer your customers through Skrill. For example:

![Shape9](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_a05461c50021f1a7.gif)

You can then define, in your HTML code, which payment method to display on the Skrill Quick Checkout page when the customer selects this logo. There are two ways in which this feature can be implemented:

- **Fixed** - only the selected payment method (or methods) is (are) displayed to the customer on Quick Checkout. The first method supplied is preselected (set as the default option).
- **Flexible** - the selected payment method is displayed as the default option (preselected). Skrill automatically detects the customer's country (using Geolocation or the country parameter passed by the merchant) and displays a localized version of the Quick Checkout page. Only the payment methods available in the customer's country are displayed. The order of the payment methods tabs is based on the popularity and conversion rate for each method in the customer's country.

Co-branded payment method logos for display on your website are available at:

[https://www.skrill.com/en/merchants/brand-centre](https://www.skrill.com/en/merchants/brand-centre)


> **Note:** The Payment methods you want to support are specified by including the relevant payment method codes in the payment request submitted to Skrill. Alternatively, it is also possible to request that only specific payment methods be enabled. For details, please contact Skrill Merchant Services.

#### Logo restrictions for non‐EU merchants

> **Note:** Read this section carefully if **your business is located outside of the EU/EEA or the US**.

For Skrill merchants based outside of the US and EU/EEA, Visa and MasterCard logos or brand names must not be used in the payment button that links to Skrill.

The Skrill processing agreement does not give you rights to display Visa and MasterCard acceptance marks on your site, and these logos should not be displayed unless you have obtained the rights to do so under a separate processing agreement.

Our compliance team conduct regular checks to ensure that this rule is enforced and failure to comply may result in suspension of your account.

For more information, see **Quick Checkout for out-of-region merchants on page 2-22**.

### Redirecting customers to Quick Checkout

You can use a standard HTML form to collect and pass payment and customer details to Quick Checkout. See **Example HTML forms on page 8-7** _. When the customer selects the Skrill option, your website should post the HTML form containing their transaction details to: [https://pay.skrill.com](https://pay.skrill.com/)[.](https://pay.skrill.com/)

The HTML form should contain the mandatory hidden input fields listed in _ **Table 2-1 on page 2-5** _.

You should use a secure method of obtaining a session ID before redirecting customers to Skrill, as described in _ **Secure redirection method on page 2-4** _.

###### Tips for improving the customer experience

- Any parameters that you pass through in your HTML form, such as customer **first name**, **last name,** and **email**, will be automatically populated (or populated and hidden) as appropriate, on the Quick Checkout payment pages making it easier for the customer to complete these forms.
- You can customize the appearance of the Quick Checkout page using the options described in **Chapter 4: Customizing the Quick Checkout Page**.
- To maximise conversion, Skrill recommends that you redirect customers to the Quick Checkout page in the same browser window.

#### 2.3.1.Secure redirection method

This method can be used to ensure that details of the payment are communicated securely between your server and Skrill.

> **Important!** We strongly recommend that you use this method when redirecting your customers to Skrill, as it does not require sending any payment parameters to their browser. This prevents customers from being able to view or modify any hidden parameters in your source code.

The redirection process is as follows:

1. Your web server makes a standard POST request with the payment parameters, using the '**prepare\_only=1**' parameter (see **Table 2-1** below).
2. The Skrill server prepares a session for the payment and returns a standard HTTP(S) response.
3. Your web server takes the body of the response which contains a **SESSION\_ID** value.
4. Using this SESSION\_ID value the customer can be redirected to:

https://pay.skrill.com/?sid=\<SESSION\_ID\>

The normal flow of events continues. This redirect must happen within 15 minutes of the original request or the session will expire.

> **Note:** The Skrill Payment Platform treats GET/POST requests to the payment URL identically. As a result, you can also use an HTTP GET operation in place of POST in step 1 above and pass the payment parameters as name/value pairs in the query string. Similarly, in Step 4 above you could use a HTTP POST operation and pass the SESSION\_ID value from Step 3 as the sid parameter in the message body.
> For code examples of how to implement this, see **Redirecting the customer to Skrill on page 5-3**.

#### Secure redirection restriction

The Quick Checkout Secure Restriction service allows merchants to create a whitelist of IP addresses (including ranges) specific to them, so that Gateway transactions are generated only for the IP addresses in the list. When the service is enabled and the list is populated, any request that doesn't have a "SID" in Skrill will be blocked. By default, the service is disabled, and the Gateway allows all payment requests, with no restrictions. Configure the service as follows:

1. Note the IP addresses/address ranges to add to the whitelist.
2. Log in to your merchant account.
3. Go to **Settings \> DEVELOPER SETTINGS**.
4. Under **Quick Checkout Secure Restriction**, set **Enable service** , and then, in the field below, type the IP addresses separated by spaces, or an address range in CIDR notation.
5. Click **Save**.

#### Parameters to be posted to Quick Checkout

Please review the table below for details of the required and optional parameters that need to be included in your form. For implementation examples, see **Example HTML forms on page 8-7**.

> **Note:** All URL parameters must include the protocol at the front of the URL for example: "https://". For example, instead of ["www.google.co.uk"](http://www.google.co.uk/) you would need to use ["https://www.google.co.uk"](https://www.google.co.uk/).

**Language Encoding for Text Parameters**

All text fields use UTF-8 encoding. Note however that the Quick Checkout payment form can only display Latin-1 characters.

#### Test Cards and Test Merchant

You may wish to test the Quick Checkout payment flow. You can use our test page at [https://pay.skrill.com/app/demo](https://pay.skrill.com/app/demo) to access the payment form parameters. Set the pay\_to\_email parameter under "Recipient" to a test merchant account, for example: demoqco@sun-fish.com. Set any other parameters as required and click "Pay" to load the Quick Checkout gateway.

**Table 2‐2: Test merchant accounts**

| **Merchant account** | **MQI/API password and secret word** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| demoqco@sun-fish.com | mqi: skrill123, secretword: skrill | Fixed Payment Options (Fixed Split Gateway) |
| demoqcoflexible@sun-fish.com | mqi: skrill123, secretword: skrill | Flexible Payment Options (Flexible Split Gateway) |
| demoqcofixedhh@sun-fish.com | mqi: skrill123, secretword: skrill | Fixed Payment Options (Fixed Split Gateway) with Reduced header option enabled. |

**Warning:** This is the live (production) payment form. If you use a real (non-test) pay\_to\_email merchant account and a valid credit card or standard Skrill account the payments will be processed and deducted from your card or Skrill wallet.

We provide three test cards shown in the table below for use with the test merchant. When using these card numbers enter an expiry date in the future and a random CVV number.

**Table 2‐3: Test cards**

| **Brand** | **Card number** |
| --- | --- |
| Mastercard | 5438311234567890 |
| Visa | 4000001234567890 |

### The Quick Checkout page

The Skrill Quick Checkout page displays the payment details submitted to Skrill, as shown in the example below.

![Shape24](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_e966a338c26361.gif)

**Figure 2-2: Example of Skrill payment page**

The customer enters their credit card details and email address, and selects **Pay Now** to confirm the payment.

At any time before the **Pay Now** button is selected, the customer can cancel the payment process and return to your website (to the URL provided in the **'cancel\_url'** field; see **Table 2-1 on page 2-5**).

**Notes:**
- The Quick Checkout payment page can be customized, as described in **Chapter 4: Customizing the Quick Checkout Page**.
- Customers who have an existing Skrill account can log in to their account to make payments, as described in **Chapter 3: Skrill Digital Wallet Payments**.
- Credit and debit card brands are not displayed on Quick Checkout for merchants who are based outside of Skrill's standard region (USA and EU/EEA). For more information, see **Quick Checkout for out-of-region merchants on page 2-22**.

#### Skrill transaction status

When the payment process is completed the '**Successful payment'** message is displayed:

![Shape25](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_2115bf32eb5e7fe4.gif)

### 2.5.Skrill status response

When the payment process is complete Skrill sends the details of the transaction to the _ **status\_url** _ page you provided in your payment request (see _ **Table 2-1 on page 2-5** _). This is done with a standard HTTP POST. The Skrill server continues to post the status until a response of HTTP OK (200) is received from your server or the number of posts exceeds 10.

The table below shows the parameters sent to your _ **status\_url** _ page:

###### Table 2‐4: Status URL parameters

###### Language encoding for text parameters

All text fields use UTF-8 encoding. Note however that the Quick Checkout can only display Latin-1 characters.

###### Validating the status response

We recommend that you validate the transaction details in the status response. This can be done as follows:

1. Create a pending transaction or order for a fixed amount on your website.
2. Redirect the customer to the Quick Checkout page, where they complete the transaction.
3. Skrill will post the transaction confirmation to your _ **status\_url** _ page. This will include the _ **mb\_amount** _ (amount) parameter.
4. Your website should validate the parameters received by calculating the md5 signature (see _ **MD5 signature on page 8-6** _). If successful, it should compare the value in the confirmation post (amount parameter) to the one from the pending transaction or order on your website.

You can also compare other parameters such as _ **transaction id** _ and _ **pay\_from\_email** _. Once you have validated the transaction data you can process the transaction, for example, by dispatching the goods ordered. You must implement measures to ensure that goods are not dispatched multiple times if you receive subsequent successful notifications for the same transaction ID (transaction\_id or mb\_transaction\_id) to protect against replay attacks or other sources of duplicate status posts.

![Shape26](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** If you want to restrict the receipt of status response based on the posting IP address, you should use the full list of Skrill IP ranges as from time to time Skrill may change the IP address used. Any address within any of the following listed ranges could be used. The full list of Skrill IP ranges are:

**91.208.28.0/24, 93.191.174.0/24, 193.105.47.0/24, 195.69.173.0/24** and

**18.156.81.39, 3.64.161.98, 18.195.181.168, 52.16.193.112, 54.228.179.122, 34.249.111.249**

If you are implementing a new integration, please use the second list, as the first one will be soon deprecated.

![Shape27](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

###### Using the Merchant Query Interface

You can use the Merchant Query Interface to repost a status report, to automatically check the status of a transaction, and to issue a refund to a customer. For details, see the [Automated Payments and](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)[Merchant](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)[Query](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)[Interfaces](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)[Guide](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)[.](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/)

#### 2.5.1.Detailed status description

**Table 2‐5: Transaction status**

| **#** | **Status** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| '2' | Processed | Sent when the transaction is processed and the funds have been received in your Skrill account. |
| '0' | Pending | Sent when the customers pays via an offline bank transfer option. Such transactions will auto-process if the bank transfer is received by Skrill. **Note** : We strongly recommend that you do _ **not** _ process the order or transaction in your system upon receipt of this status from Skrill. |
| '-1' | Cancelled | Pending transactions can either be cancelled manually by the sender in their online Skrill Digital Wallet account history or they will auto-cancel after 14 days if still pending. |
| '-2' | Failed | This status is typically sent when the customer tries to pay via Credit Card or Direct Debit but our provider declines the transaction. It can also be sent if the transaction is declined by Skrill's internal fraud engine for example: failed\_reason\_code 54 - Failed due to internal security restrictions. For a description of all failed reason codes, see _ **Failed reason codes on page 8-17** _. |
| '-3' | Chargeback | Whenever a chargeback is received by Skrill, a '_ **-3** __ **'** _ status is posted in the _ **status\_url** _ and an email is sent to the primary email address linked to the Merchant's account. Skrill also creates a new debit transaction to debit the funds from your merchant account. |

#### 2.5.2.Sales tax/VAT option

Skrill provides a configuration setting to assist merchants to calculate sales/value added tax (VAT). Contact merchant services to enable this option. Once enabled, the following three additional parameters are sent as part of the status response to the status\_urls:

**Table 2‐6: Sales tax status\_url parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| payment\_instrument\_ country | A three letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code showing the country of origin of the payment instrument the customer used. For example, a Visa card for a bank in Germany would return DEU. This value will be blank if no country can be determined for the payment method. If the customer pays using their Skrill wallet balance the payment\_instrument\_country will be the same as the country registered for their Skrill account |
| country | A three letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code. If a country parameter is passed to the payment form this value will be used. If customer pays using a Skrill Wallet the country they selected when registering their Skrill account is returned. If none of these situations apply geolocation (using the customer's IP) is used to return a 3 character country code. |
| IP\_country | A two letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code showing the customer's country as determined by Geolocation using the customer's IP. |

These values are also added to the CSV account history report. This report can be obtained using the view account history Merchant Query Interface option or via the **All Transactions \> Export CSV** option in the **My account** section after logging in to your merchant Skrill account. The following table shows the column names for these parameters in the CSV file:

**Table 2‐7: CSV parameters**

| **Status\_url parameter** | **CSV column name** |
| --- | --- |
| payment\_instrument\_country | Instrument Country |
| country | Country |
| IP\_country | IP country |

### 2.6.Process for customers who are registered with Skrill

Customers who have already registered for a Skrill Digital Wallet account can log in to their account and pay from the available balance in their account. They can also pay using one of the payment methods linked to their account, or access additional Skrill payment methods and options.

• To log in to their account the customer selects the **Pay by Skrill** tab. The following page is displayed:

![Shape28](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_ba71019fc118d978.gif)

###### Figure 2‐5: Pay by Skrill tab

The customer enters their Skrill account email address and password; they then select the **Login** button.

For more information on how customers can access their Skrill Digital Wallet account, and the options available through the Skrill Digital Wallet, see _ **Chapter 3: Skrill Digital Wallet Payments** _.

### 2.7.Securing your Skrill merchant account

It is important to secure your Skrill merchant in case your account password is compromised. Skrill provides three main methods to enhance the security of your account:

•Restricting access to your merchant account to a specific IP address or a list of IP addresses.

![Shape29](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_ff03f50f4e48e43.gif)

**Figure 2-6: Out-of-region Quick Checkout introductory screen**

Skrill recommends that you use methods 1 and 2 to secure your account. Alternatively, you can use methods 1 and 3. You cannot use the hardware token together with Google two-factor authentication. These methods are described in detail in the following pages.

#### 2.7.1.Additional security measures

If you are not planning to use the manual send money feature to transfer funds to other Skrill accounts, you can contact Skrill Merchant Servicesto ask them to disable this feature. Automated money transfers using the Skrill Automated Payment Interface are disabled by default.

![Shape30](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

# 3.SKRILL DIGITAL WALLET PAYMENTS

![Shape31](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

Additional payment options are available to customers who choose to register for or pay with their existing Skrill Digital Wallet account. You can enable the Skrill Wallet payment option using the WLT payment code as part of the payment\_methods value field. For example:

\<input type="hidden" name="payment\_methods" value="WLT,ACC"\>

### 3.1.Existing customers accessing their Skrill Wallet account

A registered customer can click the **Pay by Skrill** tab, enter their user name and password, and select the **Login** button (see _ **Pay by Skrill tab on page 2-21** _).

If the customer already has credit or debit cards configured in their Skrill account, they are given the option to select one of these cards to pay as follows:

![Shape32](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_b3b2c54c5b2d1a45.gif)

###### Figure 3‐1: Initial Skrill Wallet page

Select a card, enter the CVV number, then click **Pay Now** to process the payment. Customers can also add then pay with a new card using the **+ New card** button.

Alternatively, customers can choose to pay with their Skrill Balance. They can click the **Skrill Balance** tab to display the following screen:

###### Figure 3‐2: Pay using Skrill Balance

The customer can now review the payment details and click **Pay Now** to complete the payment. If the customer does not have a sufficient balance, the Skrill Balance will be greyed out, the **Pay Now** option will not show, and an insufficient funds message will be displayed.

### 3.2.Customers who want to register for a Skrill account

New customers do not need to register for a Skrill account, but if they want they can click the **Pay by Skrill** tab or button and select the **Sign Up** link (see _ **Pay by Skrill tab on page 2-21** _). Customer login or sign up is mandatory for certain Skrill payment options, such as Skrill 1-Tap and Recurring Billing. Selecting **Sign Up** will display the following screen:

![Shape35](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

# 4.CUSTOMIZING THE QUICK CHECKOUT PAGE

![Shape36](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

You can customize the Skrill Quick Checkout page in the following ways:

- _ **Pre-populating payment fields** _
- _ **Displaying payment and order details** _
- _ **Preselecting or displaying payment methods** _
- _ **Displaying specific credit/debit card brands** _
- _ **Straight Through Redirect** _
- _ **Displaying your company logo or brand** _
- _ **Embedding the Quick Checkout page** _
- _ **Removing or reducing the header and reducing the footer** _
- _ **Recurring billing** _

### 4.1.Pre‐populating payment fields

To speed up the payment process for the customer, you can supply the following parameters with each transaction:

###### Table 4‐1: Parameters to pre‐populate payment fields

| **Field name** | **Description** | **Max length** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pay\_from\_email | Email address of the customer who is making the payment. If provided, this field is pre- populated (or pre-populated and hidden) as appropriate, on the payment form. It will be pre-populated and hidden for the following payment methods: WCO, POLi, credit/debit card payment, and ePay. If this field is omitted or left empty, the customer has to enter their email address. | 100 | payer@skrill.com |
| firstname | First name of the customer. This value will be prefilled if the Merchant submits it via the `firstname' parameter | 20 | John |
| lastname | Last name of the customer. This value will be prefilled if the Merchant submits it via the `lastname' parameter | 50 | Payer |

The following figure shows an example of the Quick Checkout page.

![Shape37](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_e0e44f18e72106aa.gif)

###### Figure 4‐1: Skrill page with pre‐populated fields

![Shape38](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** You can include additional parameters, such as the customer's address, city, country, language, postal code, and date of birth. If the customer selects the sign-up link to open a new Skrill Digital Wallet account, these fields will be prefilled on the registration form. If they are all prefilled (address, city, country, and postal code), they will be hidden to simplify the sign-up form. See _ **Chapter 3: Skrill Digital Wallet Payments** _ for more details.

![Shape39](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

### 4.2.Displaying payment and order details

Your payment request can include your own itemised payment details, such as an order description and amount breakdown. The customer can view these payment details by selecting the **information** icon displayed next to the amount and currency.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_add10d94304c7f39.jpg)

**Figure 4‐2: Top of payment form shows total amount** Click the icon to display the Payment details overlay screen.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_d6548bab2984b5e4.jpg)

###### Figure 4‐3: Payment details screen

You can include up to five additional description fields and three amount fields (see _ **Payment details** _ in _ **Table 2-1 on page 2-5** _). For an example of HTML form, which implements these fields, see _ **Example HTML forms on page 8-7** _.

### 4.3.Preselecting or displaying payment methods

Which payment methods are displayed depends on the configuration setting for your merchant account; there are two options: Fixed or Flexible (also known as Fixed Split Gateway or Flexible Split Gateway). This feature is set up for your account by Skrill. For details, please contact Skrill MerchantServices.

The Fixed option is used to specify the payment methods to display to customers in the Quick Checkout payment form (if these payment methods are available in the customer's country). For example, you can display only Paysafecard, Klarna, and Rapid Transfer on the payment form instead of the generic Skrill options for the customer's country. These methods will appear in the Payment method tabs where their logos will be displayed. For a list of currently supported alternative payment methods and their codes, see _ **Payment method codes on page 8-9** _.

![Shape40](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_b145a29512c86d13.gif)

###### Figure 4‐4: Payment method tabs

The Flexible option is used to preselect a payment method and display it in the first payment method tab (if this payment method is available in the customer's country). The other payment methods available in this country are displayed in the other tabs.

![Shape41](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** The customer's country is determined by the country parameter passed to the Skrill Payment platform. If no country parameter is provided, Geolocation is used instead.

![Shape42](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

To use either option, the following parameter must be included in your payment request:

**Table 4‐2: Parameters to include when specifying the payment method**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Max**  **length** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| payment\_methods | This parameter has a different effect depending on the configuration of your Skrill merchant account (fixed or flexible). For the flexible option, only a single payment method code is used. For the fixed option, you can supply one or more Payment method codes separated by commas. **Note** : If you do not provide a value all the payment methods available in the customer's country are displayed. For a full list of codes, see _ **Payment method codes on page 8-9** _. | 100 | VSA,WLT, PSC |

![Shape43](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** Before implementing this option, you should also confirm which payment methods are available for your account. Restrictions apply for merchants who are based outside of Skrill's standard region (USA and Europe). For details, see _ **Quick Checkout for out-of-region merchants on page 2-22** _.

![Shape44](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

#### 4.3.1.Fixed payment methods

With the Fixed payment option, when you submit a payment method using a single _ **payment\_methods** _ parameter, _ **only that payment method is shown to the customer on the payment form.** _ If the payment method is not supported by the customer's country, the form shows all other available payment methods for this country. If you provide more than one payment method code separated by commas, the first payment method listed is preselected and shown in the first tab. The subsequent payment methods are then shown by order of their popularity in the customer's country. Note that this is used instead of the order they are listed in the _ **payment\_methods** _ parameter.

If a single payment code is used and this payment method is not available in the customer's country, the full list of available payment methods is presented to the customer. For example, if iDEAL was chosen, but the customer is not a Dutch resident. If multiple payment method codes are used, any unavailable payment methods are ignored. The following example shows the fixed payment method option with a single code:

\<input type="hidden" name="payment\_methods" value="ACC"\>

![Shape45](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_63a045a4a952b775.gif)

**Figure 4‐5: Fixed payment methods ‐ Cards only**

**4.3.1.1.Displaying specific credit/debit card brands**

By default, all card brands are displayed on Quick Checkout. You can override the default behaviour, by specifying the card brand you want to display on the payment form. This option only works with the Fixed payment method option. Use the _ **ACC** _ payment method code to display all available card brands. Only one card payment tab is permitted. See the example below.

\<input type="hidden" name="payment\_methods" value="VSA"\>

![Shape46](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9522e31a66d5298d.gif)

**Figure 4‐6: Visa‐only brand**

![Shape47](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** Restrictions apply for merchants who are based outside of Skrill's standard region (USA and Europe). For details, see _ **Quick Checkout for out-of-region merchants on page 2-22** _.

![Shape48](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

When the customer selects the _ **Credit/Debit Card** _ payment tab and enters their card number in the _ **Card number** _ field, the card type is automatically validated and the card logo is displayed, as shown in the example below.

![Shape49](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_5b9de2c9e019958b.gif)

**Figure 4‐7: Card logo displayed next to the card number**

**4.3.1.2.Straight Through Redirect**

Straight Through Redirect is used with a single payment method code to automatically redirect customers to the Payment Method provider's website without showing the Quick Checkout payment form. Once redirected, the customer provides their name and any other details required and then confirms the payment. Straight Through Redirect reduces the number of steps to complete the payment.

This option is only available if the following conditions apply:

- Your merchant account is set to use Fixed payment methods
- You pass a single payment method code in the _ **payment\_methods** _ parameter
- You provide a customer email address using the pay\_from\_email parameter, firstname parameter and lastname parameter as per the requirements in Table 4-3 below. If any of the required parameters are not provided/missing, the Quick Checkout payment form will display to allow the customer to enter their email address, first name, last name. Quick Checkout payment form will display to allow the customer to enter their email address. The customer will then need to click **Proceed to \<Payment Method\>** to continue. For example: **Proceed to ALIPAY**.

The following table lists the payment methods which support Straight Through Redirect:

**Table 4‐3: Payment methods which support Straight Through Redirect**

| **Payment Option** | **Payment\_methods** | **pay\_from\_email** | **firstname** | **lastname** |

#### 4.3.2.Flexible payment methods

With the Flexible payment option, when you submit a payment method using the _ **payment\_methods** _ parameter, that method is preselected for the customer. All other payment methods enabled for your account and for the customers' country are shown in the other payment tabs. If the chosen payment method is not supported in the customer's country, the payment tabs show all other available payment methods for this country, listed by popularity. See the example below.

\<input type="hidden" name="payment\_methods" value="OBT"\>

![Shape50](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_26050772eb167a33.gif)

**Figure 4‐8: Flexible payment methods ‐ OBT preselected**

### 4.4.Integrating Quick Checkout into your website

These options enable you to customize the appearance of the Skrill Quick Checkout page, by either adding your own logo/brand or embedding the page in your website.

#### 4.4.1.Displaying your company logo or brand

You can display your company logo on Quick Checkout. To do this your payment request should include the _ **logo** _ parameter, with a secure HTTPS link to the logo on your website. See the example below.

\<input type="hidden" name="logo" value="http[s://www.skrill.com/fileadmin/conte](http://www.skrill.com/fileadmin/content/)nt/ pdf/acme.png"\>

**Figure 4‐9: Skrill Quick Checkout with merchant logo**

#### 4.4.2.Recurring billing

Skrill Quick Checkout enables merchants to receive recurring credit card and direct debit payments from customers without a Skrill Wallet registration.

In addition to the standard HTML form parameters, you can supply the following parameters to set up recurring payments:

**Table 4‐6: Recurring payment parameters**

| **Field name** | **Description** | **Required** | **Max. length** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rec\_amount | Amount of the recurring payment (to be taken at each recurring period) | Yes | 19 | 19.90 |

| rec\_start\_date\* | Start date of the period in DD/ MM/YYYY format | No | 10 | 01/01/2018 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

# 5.ACCOUNT AND INTEGRATION OPTIONS

![Shape54](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

You can use the following account and integration options:

- _ **Secure return\_url parameter** _
- _ **Merchant refunds** _
- _ **Chargeback notification** _
- _ **Adding a descriptor** _

![Shape55](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** _ **Code integration examples on page 5-3** _ describes how to generate a session identifier and redirect the customer to Skrill.

![Shape56](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

### 5.1.Secure return\_url parameter

A secure _ **return\_url** _ parameter allows you to be certain that the customer has arrived at your _ **return\_url** _ page by completing the payment process, rather than by looking up the _ **return\_url** _ value in the page source code and entering it into their browser. However, this function only guarantees that the customer has completed the payment process, _ **not** _ that the payment had been processed. If this feature is not activated, please contact Skrill Merchant Services. You must submit the following parameters with each transaction:

- return\_url
- transaction\_id
- secret word (this will be automatically submitted if entered in the **Settings \> Developer Settings** section in your Skrill account).

Skrill will then add the following parameters to the return\_url:

###### Table 5‐1: Parameters returned with the return URL

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transaction\_id | The _ **transaction\_id** _ you submitted. | A205220 |
| msid | The MD5 signature, with the following values: •merchant\_id, for example: 123456
- transaction\_id, for example: A205220
- upper-case MD5 value of the ASCII equivalent of your secret word, for example:
F76538E261E8009140AF89E001341F17 | 730743ed4ef7ec631155f5e 15d2f4fa0 |

The following are two examples of the secure _ **return\_url** _, using the values above.

###### Example 1

Merchant submits _ **return\_url** _ without additional parameters. For example: https://example.com/return\_url.cgi

In this case Skrill will redirect the customer to:

https://example.com/

return\_url.cgi?transaction\_id=A205220&msid=730743ed4ef7ec631155f5e15d2f4fa0

###### Example 2

Merchant submits the _ **return\_url** _ with additional parameters. For example: https://example.com/return\_url.cgi?par1=val1&par2=val2 In this case Skrill will redirect the customer to:

https://example.com/return\_url.cgi?par1=val1&par2=val2&transaction\_id=A205220&msid= 730743ed4ef7ec631155f5e15d2f4fa0

### 5.2.Merchant refunds

This option enables you to refund a payment to the customer's Skrill account, credit/debit card or bank account (depending on the original payment method used). If this feature is not activated, please contact merchantservices@skrill.com.

![Shape57](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** If your account is configured to allow refunds, you will have an additional action link in the transaction history next to each entry that will trigger a refund to the customer.

![Shape58](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

You can also make refunds through Skrill's Automated Payments Interface (API). For details, see the _ **Automated Payments and Merchant Query Interfaces Guide** _.

### 5.3.Chargeback notification

When Skrill receives a chargeback request from the provider, a chargeback notification is sent to your _ **status\_url** _ page and an email is sent to the primary email address linked to your merchant Skrill account. The status code sent to the _ **status\_url** _ page is _ **-3** _. (For a description of transaction status values, see _ **Transaction status on page 2-19** _.)

### 5.4.Adding a descriptor

When a customer pays through Skrill, Skrill submits a descriptor with the transaction, containing your business trading/brand name. The descriptor is typically displayed on the bank or credit card statement of the customer. If you want to change this descriptor, please contact merchantservices@skrill.com. This functionality is only available for the following payment methods:

- Visa
- Mastercard
- Klarna
- Direct Debit
- iDEAL

![Shape59](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** This feature is not available for cards from out-of-region banks.

![Shape60](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

For Klarna and Direct Debit, you can also submit an additional payment form parameter, _ **dynamic\_descriptor** _, which will override the default value stored by Skrill.

### 5.5.Code integration examples

You can use the examples below to generate your session ID from Skrill, which is the recommended method for connecting to Quick Checkout, as described in _ **Secure redirection method on page 2-4** _.

#### 5.5.1.Generating the Session Identifier

Below are examples of how to generate a SID using different programming methods.

**cURL**

| curl -X POST https://pay.skrill.com |
| --- |
| -d "pay\_to\_email=merchant\_email@mail.com" -d "amount=10.99" |
| -d "currency=EUR" |
| -d "language=EN" -d "prepare\_only=1" |

**Ruby**

| require 'net/http' |
| --- |
| require 'net/https' |
| require 'uri' |
| uri = URI('https://pay.skrill.com') |
| http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port) http.use\_ssl = true |
| req = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.path) |
| req.set\_form\_data({ 'pay\_to\_email'=\>'merchant\_email@mail.com', |
| 'amount'=\>'10.99', |
| 'currency'=\>'EUR', 'language'=\>'EN', |
| 'prepare\_only'=\>'1' |
| }) |
| res = http.request(req) |
| puts res.body |

#### 5.5.2.Redirecting the customer to Skrill

Once you have the session identifier (SID), you have to redirect the customer to Skrill, and include the session identifier. https://pay.skrill.com?/sid=\<generated\_sid\>

Where _ **\<generated\_sid\>** _ is the SID returned by Skrill. You can open the URL with the SID as a Lightbox.

# 6.SKRILL 1‐TAP PAYMENT

![Shape62](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

Skrill offers a single-click payment service which enables you to automatically debit transactions from your customer's Skrill account without the customer having to authorise the payment each time. Customers are sent an email notification after each 1-Tap payment and they can view the status of all their Skrill 1-Tap payments in the History section of their Skrill Wallet account.

Customers can pay using Skrill 1-Tap with any of the following payment methods linked to their Skrill account:

- Credit/debit card (Visa and Mastercard)
- Direct Debit

  1. **Enabling 1‐Tap**

To enable this service, contact Skrill Merchant Services.

![Shape63](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** You must set up a separate merchant account for taking Skrill 1-Tap payments.

![Shape64](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

  1. **Enable the MQI and API**

You will need to enable the MQI (merchant query interface) and API (automated payment interface) and set up an MQI/API password to use 1-Tap. You can also change the MQI/API password here in this section.

To enable the MQI and/or API:

1. Log in to your Skrill account at[www.skrill.com](http://www.skrill.com/)[.](http://www.skrill.com/)
2. Go to **Settings \> Developer Settings**  **\> API / MQI / GSR / CVT Management**.
3. Set the API / MQI Password, and click **Save** to confirm.
4. Specify at least one IP address from which requests will be made. All requests from other IP addresses are denied. Access can be granted to:
  - A single IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.2)
  - Multiple IP addresses, separated by a space (e.g. 192.168.0.2 10.0.0.2)
  - A subnet in CIDR notation (e.g. 175.10.10.252/30).

![Shape65](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Warning:** CIDR ranges should be no longer than 256 IP addresses.

| \<input type="submit" value="Pay!"\> \</form\> |

**6.6.**** Taking subsequent 1‐Tap payments**

Once a Skrill 1-Tap payment has been set up, you must use the Skrill 1-Tap Payment Interface (part of Skrill's Automated Payment Interface) to make individual requests to debit the customer's Skrill account. If you have provided a _ **status\_url** _ value in your HTML form, Skrill will post the transaction details of each payment to that URL.

###### Connecting to the 1‐Tap interface

You can connect to the Skrill 1-Tap interface by sending HTTPS GET/POST requests to: [https://www.skrill.com/ap](http://www.skrill.com/app/ondemand_request.pl)p/onde[mand\_request.pl](http://www.skrill.com/app/ondemand_request.pl) **Notes:**

- You must enable the Skrill Automated Payment Interface (API) and setup an MQI/API password
- Skrill recommend using POST for maximum security.
- Do not mix GET and POST requests. Choose which method to use and apply consistently.
- POST parameters are encoded using Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- GET parameters are encoded in the URI query string using & delimiters (e.g. GET parameters are sent as part of the URL query string[https://www.skrill.com/](http://www.skrill.com/app/query.pl?action=status)app/que[ry.pl?action=status](http://www.skrill.com/app/query.pl?action=status)\_trn&email=mb654@abv.bg&password=53903d217504eb37f3fdb0ce77610558&mb\_trn\_id

=104627261)

Taking subsequent 1-Tap Payments is a two-step process:

1. Send a first request with action set to prepare to receive a session ID for step 2
2. Send a second request with action set to request using the session ID from step 1 to execute the payment.

These steps are described in more detail below.

###### 6.6.1.Prepare payment step

Action parameter: **action=prepare**

This action prepares the transaction that will be executed later using the request action. The following parameters are required:

**Table 6‐2: Parameters to include with the prepare request**

| **Field name** | **Description** | **Required** | **Example value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| email | The email address linked to your Skrill account | Yes | info@example.com |
| password | The lowercase hex MD5 of your API/MQI password | Yes | 9f535b6ae672f627e 4e5f79f2b7c63fe |
| action | The required action | Yes | prepare |
| amount | The amount of the request for a debit transaction | Yes | 10.50 |
| currency | 3-letter code of the currency you wish to debit according to ISO 4217 | Yes | EUR |
| ondemand\_note | Text shown to the customer in the payment confirmation email as the reason for the Skrill 1-Tap payment | No | Credit topped up |
| frn\_trn\_id | Your transaction ID, used for the payment. This is your own unique reference for this transaction | Yes | A205220 |
| rec\_payment\_id | Recurring payment ID (_ **rec\_payment\_id** _ value) sent to your _ **status\_url** _ page when you created the Skrill 1-Tap payment | Yes | 200005 |
| merchant\_fields | A comma-separated list of field names that are passed back to your Web server when the Skrill 1-Tap payment is confirmed (maximum 5 fields) | No | Field1, Field2 |
| Field1 | An additional field you can include, containing your own unique parameters. | No | Value1 |
| Field2 | An additional field you can include, containing your own unique parameters. | No | Value2 |

**Notes:**

- Both _ **frn\_trn\_id** _ and _ **rec\_payment\_id** _ should be provided. You should use the r_ **ec\_payment\_id** _ field to reference the original 1-Tap transaction and provide a unique _ **frn\_trn\_id** _ as the reference for the current transaction.
- If _ **ondemand\_note** _ is not provided, the one that is submitted when creating the Skrill 1-Tap payment will be used.
- A session identifier (SID) parameter is returned upon success.

You can track the status of any 1-Tap transaction and perform refunds using the unique _ **frn\_trn\_id** _ for that transaction.

**Skrill response**

Skrill returns an XML response to your prepare request which contains a \<response\> tag with one of the following elements:

- **sid** element - returned if the authorisation and payment preparation is successful. The SID (session identifier) must be submitted in your transfer execution request.
- **error** element - included if an error occurs. It includes an \<error\_msg\> tag, which contains the error message description.

##### 7.ASTROPAY

![Shape85](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

This section explains the Skrill payment flow for the Astropay payment method available in Argentina, and India. Astropay is composed of two subcategories:

- Bank Transfer (two transfer types are available: Direct or Manual)
- Cash/Invoice

![Shape86](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** Astropay is only available for payments greater than or equal to 10 USD. Contact SkrillMerchant Servicesto enable each of the different Astropay payment methods listed above.

![Shape87](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

These categories are described in more detail below. Not all categories are supported in all the countries where Astropay is available, see _ **List of banks supported by country on page 7-14** _ for a list of all the banks or cash payment networks that Astropay supports in each country and which payment category they support. If a country is not listed, it does not support Astropay.

Astropay integration is the same as the standard Skrill integration, however, the merchant's integration code must handle interim pending payment status notifications and be prepared to receive the final payment success notification some days, weeks, or months later (in the case of cash/ invoice payment).

The Skrill Quick Checkout payment form can show two Astropay tabs: Cash and Bank Transfer. The Bank Transfer tab is used for both Direct and Manual bank transfers. You can restrict which tabs are shown by using the Fixed Split Gateway option and the payment method codes listed in _ **Astropay payment method codes on page 7-14** _.

When a customer selects the appropriate tab they will see the logos of all supported banks (or in the case of Cash, supported payment networks) and a drop-down menu where they can select the bank or payment network they wish to use. If only one bank or payment network is supported in the customer's country, this logo will appear instead of Cash or Bank Transfer to increase conversion. If the merchant passes a payment method code, they can restrict the Bank Transfer page to only show Direct or Manual banks in the drop-down menu on the Bank Transfer tab, as appropriate.

Finally, this section includes a description of the refund process which differs from the standard refund process as user action is required.

**7.1.**  **Bank transfer**

###### Direct bank transfer

Direct bank transfer is the simplest method for customers. The payment flow is as follows:

1. The customer clicks **Pay by Bank Transfer** on the merchant website and is redirected to the Skrill Quick Checkout payment form.
2. The customer enters their first and last name (if these are not supplied by the merchant).
3. The customer enters their National Identity number (this field has a different name depending on the country, e.g., CPF, RUT, ID, DNI).
4. The customer selects a local bank in the Skrill payment form and clicks **Proceed to Online Bank**. The list of available banks depends on the country selected. If the bank supports Direct Bank Transfer the payment flow continues, otherwise, the flow will be as described in _ **Manual bank transfer** _ below.
5. The customer is redirected to the chosen bank's website where they can log in and approve a bank transfer to make payment.
6. Once payment is complete, Skrill shows a successful payment form and sends a response containing the payment status to the merchant's _ **status\_url** _.
7. The customer clicks the button on the success form to return to the merchant website. The merchant website should check the payment status received at the _ **status\_url** _ for the payment to determine the message to show to the customer.
8. When the merchant receives a valid payment confirmation with a status value of 2 at the merchant's _ **status\_url** _ they can release the goods to the customer.

###### Manual bank transfer

The manual bank transfer payment flow is as follows:

1. The customer clicks **Pay by Bank Transfer** on the merchant website and is redirected to the Skrill Quick Checkout payment form.
2. The customer selects a local bank from a drop-down menu in the payment form (the list of available banks depends on the country selected). If the bank supports Manual Bank Transfer the payment flow continues, otherwise, the flow will be as described in _ **Direct Bank Transfer** _ above.
3. The customer clicks **Proceed to Online Bank**. A form is displayed showing the manual bank transfer details required to complete the payment. Note that the amount will always be displayed in the local currency in that country rather than the currency selected in the merchant website. The transfer details will always be displayed in the local language.
4. The customer clicks on **Do Transfer** (Realizar Transferencia in Spanish) to be redirected to the selected bank's website where they can manually complete the payment.
5. Once the transfer is complete, the customer clicks **Already Deposited** (Ya Desposité in Spanish) in the Skrill payment form and a pending notice is shown on the Skrill payment form. This informs customer that payment is pending.
6. The customer can now click the **Continue** button to return to the merchant website. The merchant website should check the payment status received at the _ **status\_url** _ for the payment to determine the message to show to the customer.
7. Once payment is complete, Skrill receives confirmation and sends a payment success notification to the merchant's _ **status\_url** _. Note that this may take 1-2 days after the customer

**\* Not available for US and Canada merchants**

has made the bank transfer. When the merchant receives a valid payment confirmation with a status value of 2 at their _ **status\_url** _ they can release the goods to the customer.

**7.2.**** Cash/Invoice**

The cash payment flow is as follows:

1. The customer clicks **Pay by Cash/ Invoice** on the merchant website. They are then redirected to the Skrill Quick Checkout Payment form.
2. The customer selects a local bank/payment network from the drop-down menu (the list of available banks depends on the country selected).
3. The customer enters their first and last name (if these are not supplied by the merchant).
4. The customer enters their National Identity number (This field has a different name depending on the country, for example: CPF, RUT, ID, DNI, etc.)
5. The customer is redirected to the bank/payment network website for confirmation.
6. The bank/payment network website displays a bar code that the customer must print.
7. The customer goes to the bank or a store which belongs to the payment network and pays in cash using the bar code they were given in step 6. Alternatively, they can pay the invoice using their online banking.
8. Once payment is complete, Skrill receives the confirmation. Skrill sends a payment success notification to the merchant's _ **status\_url** _.
9. Once the merchant receives a valid payment confirmation with a status value of 2 at the merchant's _ **status\_url** _ they can release the goods to the customer.

**Figure 7‐16: Pending payment**

**7.3.**** Refunds**

Astropay supports full and partial refunds. Customers receive an email when the merchant triggers a refund. This email contains a link to a form on the Astropay website with a Skrill logo where customers specify their name, bank account, and the security code contained in the email. Astropay will then send a refund to the customer's bank. Refunds take up to two working days from receipt of these details.

When the refund is executed by the merchant, an email is sent to the customer and the refund is set to pending. The refund status changes to processed when the customer provides their bank account details and Astropay sends the payment to their bank. Note that payment will still take up to two working days to reach the customer's account.

![Shape91](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Warning:** If you use the refund call in the Skrill Automated Payment Interface you must ensure that your provide a _ **refund\_status\_url** _ to record the change from pending to processed.

**7.4.**** Astropay payment method codes**

The following table lists the Payment Method Codes for Astropay and their effects. These codes can be used with the Fixed Split Gateway option to launch the payment form with a single Astropay tab. They are also returned in the _ **payment\_type** _ parameter in both Gateway types (Fixed or Flexible, where enabled) to show which Astropay payment type the customer used.

###### Table 7‐1: Payment method codes

| **Transfer Type** | **Fixed Split Gateway Effect** | **Payment Method** |

##### 8.GIFT CARDS

![Shape98](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

This section explains the Skrill payment flow for some popular retail gift cards available throughout the US, such as CVS Pharmacy, Dollar General and Circle K. Customers can buy gift cards at more than 31,000 point of sale locations and then use them to pay online with participating merchants.

Gift card payment options support Straight Through Redirect, where customers are automatically redirected to a specific payment page if you provide the correct payment method code along with other mandatory parameters. When you set up gift card payments, this is the option we recommend.

**8.1.**** Customer payment flow**

1. When the customer is ready to pay, they select the relevant gift card payment method on your checkout page.
2. The customer is redirected to the payment platform to enter their gift card number / PIN and complete their purchase.

Gift cards are redeemed in real-time with the retail issuer and instantly validated with a 100% no chargeback guarantee to you.

  1. **Enabling gift cards**

To enable your merchant ID to accept gift card payments, contact SkrillMerchant Services.

  1. **Configuration options**

Once we have enabled your merchant ID to accept gift card payments, you will need to configure the payment button or buttons on your website using the correct payment method codes.

###### Configuration example

| https://pay.skrill.com/?merchant\_id=01111000000&amount=20.00&currency=USD&co |
| --- |
| untry=USA&pay\_from\_email=customeremail@domain.com& **payment\_methods=CVS** | |

You have three different configuration options:

- Display separate payment buttons for each gift card you accept.
- Display one payment button to represent all gift cards you accept.
- Display one payment button to represent gift cards along with other payment methods you accept.

###### Display separate payment buttons (recommended option)

With this configuration option, you display separate payment buttons on your website for each gift card you accept. When the customer clicks on a payment button, they will be redirected directly to a specific gift card payment page to complete their purchase.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9c902441399eaf37.png)

**Figure 8‐1: Example redirect to the CVS gift card payment page**

Configure your gift card payment buttons using the following payment method codes:

**Table 8‐1: Gift card payment method codes**

| **Gift card** | **Parameter** | **Example button / text requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVS Pharmacy | payment\_methods=CVS | ![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_3e58d92d3f13a542.png) **CVS Pharmacy gift card** |
| Dollar General | payment\_methods=DLG | ![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_f940e707a5a509f1.png) **Dollar General gift card** |
| Circle K | payment\_methods=CRK | ![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_b7d3581c1fa55bdf.png) **Circle K gift card** |

**Mandatory parameters**

In order to redirect the customer directly to the relevant payment page, you must pass the payment code along with the following mandatory parameters:

- Customer's first name_ **: firstname** _
- Customer's last name_ **: lastname** _
- Customer's email address_ **: pay\_from\_email** _

For more details about these parameters refer to the _ **Quick Checkout parameters table on page 13** _.

###### Display one gift cards payment button

With this configuration option, you display one payment button on your website to represent all the different gift cards you accept. When the customer clicks on the payment button, they will be redirected to a card selector page where they can select their desired gift card. The customer will then be redirected again to complete their purchase on the relevant gift card payment page.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_7ad9f2b7e0cadc8c.png)

**Figure 8‐2: Example redirect to a gift card selector page**

Configure your gift card payment button using the following payment method code:

**Table 8‐2: Combined gift card payment method code**

| **Gift card** | **Parameter** | **Example button / text requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All gift cards that your merchant ID is enabled to accept. | payment\_methods=GFC | ![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_1fcae3e2a6bd3e23.png) **Cash / Gift cards** |

**Note:** If you have different gift card options activated to those shown in the above example, please contact your account manager for a custom button to fit your checkout requirements.

###### Display one payment button for all payment methods

With this configuration option, you display one payment button on your website to represent all the different payment methods you accept, such as gift cards and paysafecard. When the customer clicks on the payment button, they will be redirected to a card selector page on the Skrill gateway where they will be shown all the payment options enabled on your merchant ID. After selecting a payment method, the customer will be redirected again to the relevant payment page to complete their purchase.

**Note:** Customers also follow this payment flow if you do not provide a payment method parameter.

![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_439604a404fb80ed.jpg)

**Figure 8‐3: Example redirect to a payment method selector page**

**Table 8‐3: Combined payment method codes**

| **Gift card** | **Parameter** | **Example button / text requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All gift cards that your merchant ID is enabled to accept. | payment\_methods=PSC,GFC | ![](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_90d5ac6c062eea34.png) **Cash / Gift cards** |

**Note:** If you have different card options activated to those shown in the above example, please contact your account manager for a custom button to fit your checkout requirements.

**9.4.**** MD5 signature**

A hidden text field called _ **md5sig** _ is included in the form submitted to your server. The value of this field is a 128-bit message digest, expressed as a string of thirty-two hexadecimal digits in UPPERCASE. The _ **md5sig** _ is constructed by performing an MD5 calculation on a string built up by concatenating the fields returned to your _ **status\_url** _ page. This includes:

- merchant\_id
- transaction\_id
- the uppercase MD5 value of the ASCII equivalent of the secret word submitted in the **Settings**** \> Developer Settings** section of your online Skrill account.
- mb\_amount
- mb\_currency
- status

The purpose of the _ **md5sig** _ field is to ensure the integrity of the data posted back to your server. You should always compare the _ **md5sig** _ field's value posted by Skrill's servers with the one you calculated. To calculate the _ **md5sig** _, you need to take the values of the fields listed above exactly as they were posted back to you, concatenate them, and perform a MD5 calculation on this string.

###### Cancelled payment

The MD5 hash posted on the _ **ondemand\_status\_url** _ when a Skrill 1-Tap payment has been cancelled is a concatenation of the following fields:

- MERCHANT\_ID = merchant\_id
- MERCHANT\_TRN\_ID = transaction\_id
- The uppercase MD5 value of the ASCII equivalent of the secret word submitted in the **Settings \> Developer Settings** section of the Merchant's online Skrill account
- REC\_PMT\_STATUS = status
- TRN\_ID = rec\_payment\_id

The MD5 hash for 1-Tap payments, posted on the _ **status\_url** _ is calculated the same way as normal payments/refunds.

###### Secret word

The secret word must be submitted in the **Settings \> Developer Settings** section of your Skrill Digital Wallet account before the _ **md5sig** _ can be used. The following restrictions apply when submitting your secret word:

- All characters must be in lowercase
- The length should not exceed 10 characters
- Special characters are not permitted (for example @, %, $, etc.)

![Shape101](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** If the **Settings \> Developer Settings** section is not displayed in your account, contact merchantservices@skrill.com.

![Shape102](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

  1. **SHA2 signature**

To improve the security of the status reports, Skrill posts an additional parameter with the report called _ **sha2sig** _. This is constructed in the same way as the _ **md5** _ signature, but with a different hashing algorithm, _ **Sha2** _ (256 bits).

![Shape103](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** This new parameter is not available by default. To enable this option, send a request to merchantservices@skrill.com.

![Shape104](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

  1. **Example HTML forms**

Below are two examples of HTML forms that can be submitted to Skrill. The first one is a basic example.

The second example uses several additional features currently available with Quick Checkout. You can use these forms, ensuring that the values are replaced with your own values.

###### 9.7.1.Alipay

The Alipay payment method is restricted to customers from China.

![Shape109](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

**Note:** Only merchants outside China can offer this payment method

![Shape110](RackMultipart20230727-1-clbscd_html_9451e83f8c4be39c.gif)

The following currencies are supported: EUR, USD, GBP, HDK, and SGD. Other currencies will be processed but Skrill will convert the payment amount to Euros and charge the merchant a conversion fee, see[https://www.skrill.com/en/fees/](https://www.skrill.com/en/fees/)[f](https://www.skrill.com/en/fees/)or details. There are two integration options for Alipay:

- Straight through redirect.
- Payment tab selection.

These methods are described in more detail below.

**Straight‐through redirect**

A straight-through redirect bypasses the Quick Checkout form and sends the payment details direct to Alipay. To use this method you need to first ensure your merchant account is configured for the Fixed payment option. The next step is to provide the customer's email in the _ **pay\_from\_email** _ parameter and pass a single _ **payment\_method** _ code, ALI as part of the payment request. If you don't pass the _ **pay\_from\_email** _ parameter, the Quick Checkout payment form will be displayed. The customer will see a prompt asking them to enter their email before continuing to Alipay.

**Payment tab selection**

If you use the Fixed payment option and pass more than one payment method code including the ALI code Alipay will appear as a standard payment tab on the form for Chinese customers. Alipay will also appear as a standard payment tab for Chinese customers if the merchant account is configured to use the Flexible payment option.

###### 9.7.2.Alipay customs declaration

If you are shipping physical goods to customers in China paying with Alipay, you will need to make a customs declaration. This declaration should be made immediately after a successful payment. Skrill provide two MQI API calls for this purpose: one call to submit a customs declaration and a second call to check the status of an existing declaration.

Before continuing, you must first enable the MQI, set up an API/MQI password, and specify an IP range from which MQI calls can be made. Refer to the introductory section of the[Skrill](https://www.skrill.com/en/business/integration/) AutomatedPayment Interface Guidefor information about enabling and configuring the MQI.

Once you have enabled the MQI, you can use the two calls. These calls are described in detail below.

**Send a customs declaration**

This call sends a customs declaration about an Alipay purchase to Chinese customs. The request contains the merchant's Skrill account email and MQI/API password (in MD5 form) along with information about the payment such as transaction reference, amount, the merchant's identification details and the selected customs to which the purchased item will be shipped. Alipay verifies the request details to check that they match a successful payment registered in their system and then sends them on to Chinese customs. Finally, Alipay returns a response to the merchant (via Skrill) with the associated transaction ID for the payment (Alipay's transaction ID) and a customs declaration number.

| **Method** | **Endpoint** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | https://api.skrill.com/mqi/customs/ alipay/ | Send customs declaration to Alipay customs API |

You should add the following header to your HTTP request:

Content-Type: application/json;
